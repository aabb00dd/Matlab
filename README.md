# MATLAB School Projects

This repository contains several MATLAB projects created as part of my coursework in signal processing and systems analysis. Each project focuses on a specific concept, such as adaptive filters, Fourier analysis, sampling, and linear time-invariant systems.

## About the Project
The purpose of these MATLAB projects was to learn and demonstrate core concepts in signal processing and system analysis, including:
- Implementing adaptive filters using algorithms like NLMS
- Performing Fourier analysis (FFT and Fourier Series) to study frequency-domain behavior
- Simulating LTI systems using FIR filters
- Understanding the principles of signal sampling and reconstruction
- Applying mathematical and theoretical knowledge to practical, script-based simulations in MATLAB

Each project focuses on a specific topic covered in coursework, providing hands-on experience with signal behavior, algorithm development, and MATLAB programming.
